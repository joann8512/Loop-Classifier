# Loop-Classifier

The proposed work introduces a new type of auto-taggingtask, called instrument role classification. We  discuss why the task is necessary, especially under the setting of making electronic music. Loopbased music and the general background regarding the creation of thisspecific style is also introduced. We approach this task with a previouslyintroduced  Convolutional Neural  Network  architecture,  the  HarmonicCNN  (HCNN). A  new  use  case  of  this  method  is  presented  by  usingthe Freesound Loop Dataset (FSLD), emphasizing its learning efficiencyunder limited data. Finally, we present baselines to highlight these ad-vantages.
